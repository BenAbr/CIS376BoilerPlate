		<p>The past year since my major change to CIS, I have been experiencing all different kinds of coding 
		languages such as <b>HTML, Python, and Java. </b></p>

		<p>This semester, I've been learning about HTML, CSS, and C++ which I think could be very useful in the future. The most difficult one would probably have
		to be C++ since it's a completely new format to Java, which I have the most experience with.</p>
		<p>I still don't understand the C++ syntax too well, but I'll figure it out eventually.</p>
